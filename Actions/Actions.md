Some actions and events are collected randomly from the draw pile, and others may be inherent to a Role (character). The successful execution of some of either of those are dependent on a dice roll, weighed by a dynamic probability factor which is based on other game metrics such as political unity, national instability, public approval, etc. Think of it as multidimensional karma. 

The more you build up a certain resource, the more actions you have access to, and your odds of success on those actions are also improved.

This is implemented by selecting a base target number that needs to be rolled for success, and then modifying this target number based on various factors. For instance, with an assassination attempt, you might have a base target of 8 on a d10. This would mean the base chance of success is 30%. However, for each level of instability in the opponent's country, the target value may be reduced, thus increasing the chance of success. So the more unstable the country, the higher the chance of success for the assassination attempt.

In the matter of blackmail, a high espionageEfficacy score and having several "spy" or "field agent" workers deployed by the Director of the CIA, and/or a high leverage score might make it really easy to convert an opponents spy worker into a mole. But first, the intelligence that blows the cover of the spy must be acquired...


Secret Meetings

Spies or diplomats may decide to meet in secret to exchange intel or reach resolutions. Domestic approval is not affected but players may get a chance to gain intel. If a player's spy has a contact or source they may meet to gain intel, or meet with their opponent and they can both get the chance to gain intel. 

## Calculating odds
The odds of rolling a specific number or higher on a dice can be expressed as: 

`(number of sides - target number + 1) / number of sides`

So with a target number of 8 on a d10, the odds of success are:

`(10 - 8 + 1) / 10 = 0.3` or 30%. 

If the target number is reduced to 7 due to instability, the odds of success become:

`(10 - 7 + 1) / 10 = 0.4` or 40%.
