Random events can be good or bad, and rarely, neutral. Some random events are for you to play against your opponent at a turn of your chossing, and others have an immediate affect, causing an unstoppable event that will change the game at random. 

Uncontrollable Events: 
i.e.: a natural disaster on the homeland, 

Some are random with a dynamic probability distribution based on shifts in measures such as political unity, national instability, and public approval.

For example, a protest is more likely to occur as the scores for public approval and political unity drop 

Other events are triggered by another threshold value, or combination of threshold values, being reached, and will definitely happen once certain conditions are met.
