Workers amplify the affects of plays by the people they repor to (Roles)

Sometimes they need to be placed with specific links to other components at play, and will only contribute to effects played on that associated component.

They do not directly impact the scales of the game. They can only add efficacy or dampen other events or abilities.

Agents:
Intelligence Officer workers can be assigned for different purposes. Put an officer in one of your established intelligence resources and they become an Analyst. Another officer could be placed in an embassy under the cover of a diplomat. The worker being placed in this way assigns them as a spy (an analyst with additional abilities). An opponent may uncover a spy by gaining intelligence, which is done through actions that are provided through abilities gained by establishing intelligence agencies and deploying workers (intelligence officers)). A player may choose to reassign a worker within their role as long as the requirements are met.

Abilities:
Abilities are actions provided by resources and workers. Proposing a Treaty requires both players have embassies and diplomats in each other's territory, and for at least one of their Secretary's of State (or equivalent) to be willing to travel (or both could meet in Geneva, though several diplomacy and international standing points are awarded to the player who travels their State secretary.

An assassination attempt is an action only provided by a spy or a mole, and it comes with a substantial risk factor. It's success probability is based on level of relavent resources and status of the target. The consequence of failure is based on status of the target and a probabilistically determined context score, to capture the varying natures in which a failure could transpire.
